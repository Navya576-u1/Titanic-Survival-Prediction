# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project predicts the **survival of passengers aboard the Titanic** using machine learning. The goal is to identify which factors — such as age, gender, and class — had the greatest influence on survival chances.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature selection and encoding  
4. Model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
5. Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Females had a higher survival rate than males  
- First-class passengers had better chances of survival  
- Younger passengers were more likely to survive  

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb
